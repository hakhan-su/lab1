                                        Like many American designers, Wu has been accused of being “too commercial.” (It’s hard to imagine the insult stinging in industries such as technology or aerospace, where no one questions that the point is to sell stuff.) Wu remains undeterred. Last year, he launched a sporty second line—named Grey, for his favorite color—to dress his female clients on weekends and errand runs. He plans to promote it this fall by taking over the lobby of Cadillac’s New York headquarters, on Hudson Street, for several weeks, covering the space entirely in gray and selling gray-colored products that he likes, including Sharpies, LeSportsac bags, and Behr paint.

                                        Tying a fashion brand to pedestrian products requires a deft touch. New York shows sponsored by the sports- and talent-management company IMG have sometimes had a hucksterish quality, with pitches for sponsors’ energy drinks, nail polish, and even beer taking place as fashion editors race to their seats. Yet American designers also understand the necessity of careful cross-promotion, which, when deployed with finesse, can give a helping hand to upstarts, some of whom will grow up to be the next Jason Wu.

                            Paris, at its haute-couture, men’s, and women’s prêt-à-porter weeks, produces the conceptual looks that magazine editors dream of. New York designers, by contrast, make clothes that lots and lots of women wear. As this season’s New York Fashion Week, which started last Wednesday, has revealed, the key to retaining New York’s relevance might just be to double down on its most American qualities. Chic yoga pants or swell tailored jackets are nothing to be ashamed of. Many women want great designer clothes that fit well and won’t scare their colleagues.
                            And yet showing such outfits on the runway requires a knack. On Tom Ford’s runway last Wednesday night, at the Park Avenue Amory, one of the most talked-about looks was a pair of sparkly long-sleeved shirts. My daughter, my mother, and I could wear them over slacks or a skirt without raising an eyebrow. Ford sent his models down the catwalk with nothing on underneath but panties and stiletto heels. (In the fashion business, they call that savvy editorializing.) His collection crossed the sporty track and yoga clothing that the moms at his son’s Los Angeles elementary school wear at morning drop-off and the red-carpet looks those same moms wear on certain nights out. Ford, who has spent the better part of his career showing collections for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, and other deluxe brands in Paris, Milan, and London, plans to stick with New York for his eponymous label. When, after his show, I mentioned the upstarts’ departure for Paris, his response was a friendly but dismissive yawn. “I like them,” he said, perched on the arm of a vinyl couch. “I hope they have a good time there.”
