                    When a number of New York’s most prominent fashion designers decided to abandon the city’s fall Fashion Week in favor of those happening in Paris, their defections were not well received here. New York’s industry is struggling with a shrinking garment district and worryingly slow retail sales, but the city has arguably tried harder than Paris to nurture young talent with free show spaces, mentoring, and enthusiastic promotion. The defecting labels—which include Rodarte, Proenza Schouler, Altuzarra, and Thom Browne—gave varying reasons along a similar theme for their decisions: they wanted to seek new markets and benefit from the elegance and sophistication of Paris, the most glamorous and competitive of the world’s fashion capitals. Another reason—that New York Fashion Week has sometimes been tainted by a trade-show atmosphere—was generally left unsaid.

                    Paris, at its haute-couture, men’s, and women’s prêt-à-porter weeks, produces the conceptual looks that magazine editors dream of. New York designers, by contrast, make clothes that lots and lots of women wear. As this season’s New York Fashion Week, which started last Wednesday, has revealed, the key to retaining New York’s relevance might just be to double down on its most American qualities. Chic yoga pants or swell tailored jackets are nothing to be ashamed of. Many women want great designer clothes that fit well and won’t scare their colleagues.
                    And yet showing such outfits on the runway requires a knack. On Tom Ford’s runway last Wednesday night, at the Park Avenue Amory, one of the most talked-about looks was a pair of sparkly long-sleeved shirts. My daughter, my mother, and I could wear them over slacks or a skirt without raising an eyebrow. Ford sent his models down the catwalk with nothing on underneath but panties and stiletto heels. (In the fashion business, they call that savvy editorializing.) His collection crossed the sporty track and yoga clothing that the moms at his son’s Los Angeles elementary school wear at morning drop-off and the red-carpet looks those same moms wear on certain nights out. Ford, who has spent the better part of his career showing collections for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, and other deluxe brands in Paris, Milan, and London, plans to stick with New York for his eponymous label. When, after his show, I mentioned the upstarts’ departure for Paris, his response was a friendly but dismissive yawn. “I like them,” he said, perched on the arm of a vinyl couch. “I hope they have a good time there.”
